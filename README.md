# Punk-API (Brewdog database project)

This is the repository for my Punk-API front-end project, made using React, SCSS, Firebase and TypeScript. It displays information about brewdog beers, and allows the user to favourite beers that they like.

## Getting started

Instructions:

1. Clone this repository
2. use npm install to install any required packages
3. Use npm run dev to use the web app.
4. This repo uses locally stored data about the beers, it was originally intended to work in tandem with the Punk-API site online, but that has been taken down.

## Functionality

The main page of this web app is a page displaying all of the beers. The user can apply filters here, and search for beers by name. For each individual beer card, the user has the option to read a description, see how it is made, or add it to their favourites.

A second main function of the web app is the virtual sommelier, this allows the user to search for a food, and then the sommelier will recommend a beer to pair with this food.

Lastly, the user can look at their favourites on the "favourites page" (rather predictably). This is linked to their login, so it should work across different devices.

# Tips

The sommelier recommends a random choice out of the available options, so if you don't like the suggested choice, try submitting again and he may suggest something different.
